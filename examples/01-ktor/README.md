# ktor-samples 
- subset obtained via https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor/tree/master/ktor-samples

ktor.io is in the process of changing things around
 with packages and refactoring code base to use io.ktor instead of org.jetbrains.ktor.
 
 The plans will be to use ktor to handle web client and web service processing.
 That combined with co-routines will be to create a reactive framework.
 The work is planning on 100% Kotlin so they can compile native.
 
 #####WARNING:  This site is unstable and going through changes in code base and examples.
